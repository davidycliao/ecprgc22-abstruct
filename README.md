## Visualization Keyword Extracted from Abstructs of 2022 ECPR General Conference


The keyword extraction method is one approach to understanding linguistic patterns and getting more insight from the text. 
This example uses an industrial-strength NLP library, [SpaCy](https://spacy.io) and Textrank implanted as [PyTextRank](https://spacy.io/universe/project/spacy-pytextrank).  Textrank can extract keywords as phrases and summarises the most representative terms from the corpus. 
PyTextRank is part of  SpaCy plugin, which makes things easy!!!!
